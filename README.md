# Tableau Trailhead Modules & Data Storytelling Viz

## Project Overview

I utilized Tableau Public to support data storytelling by using multiple related tables and completed modules part of the **Tableau Hands-On Challenges** Trailhead content.

For this viz, I used a mental health data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/mental-health). I used prevalence data for Anxiety disorders and Eating disorders across multiple countries, as well as DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) data to represent the disease burden. I created a bar chart to show the prevalence of these two disorders for each country. I also created a line chart to show DALYs over time for the same two disorders, to show how the health burden has changed over the years.

## Reflection

From the *Data Storytelling with Tableau Public*, I learned to focus on certain elements to create a simple visulization. I learned how to choose the appropriate chart type and metrics, as well as learned the importance of choosing the color and layout to make it visually appealing to viewers. From the *The Tableau Data Model*, I learned it is important to use relationships when combining tables. This is especially important when datasets have different structures, so these relationships ensure that analyses are accurate and easy to update. My project demonstrates how Tableau can be used to showcase patient outcomes. By visualizing prevalence and disease burden by disorder type, Tableau can show how widespread a condition is and what improvements could be made.
